# SportRadar_assessment

Notes:

The SportRadarMatch class represents individual matches with their scores and status,
while the Scoreboard class manages all the ongoing matches and provides operations to start, update, and finish matches.
The GetMatchesInProgressByTotalScore method returns the list of matches ordered by their total score and whether they are finished or not, as per the requirements.

TDD was used in testing
XUnit fraeowkr was used for writing unit test.
